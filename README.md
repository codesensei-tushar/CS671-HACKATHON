CS-671 Deep Learning and Applications Hackathon (CrowdFlowAI â€“ Intelligent Pedestrian Flow Monitoring for Large Human Gatherings)

Mass gatherings like the Kumbh Mela present significant challenges for crowd safety and management. With millions of pilgrims attending, the risk of chaotic pedestrian flow and stampede-like situations becomes high. To enhance crowd safety and enable proactive management, we aim to develop an AI-powered system that monitors pedestrian movement in real-time, detects anomalies, and simulates potential panic scenarios.
