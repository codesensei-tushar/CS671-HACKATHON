# CS671-HACKATHON
Design a deep learning and computer vision-based system that processes CCTV footage from large
human gatherings (e.g., Kumbh Mela) to:
• Detect and count pilgrims/pedestrians in real time.
• Track individual and collective pedestrian paths.
• Simulate panic situations after a time interval t and predict changes in flow dynamics.
• Analyze pedestrian flow to detect early signs of stampede-like conditions
